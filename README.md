# THE NBA MVP API
A simple NBA MVP API that will return the base stats from any NBA MVP winner post 2000.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and NodeJS

**Client**
The client side is a simple HTML site with some styling that explains how to retrieve the data from API.

**Server**
The server-side was built using vanillaJS and NodeJS. The vanillaJS was used to create an array object of that hold the MVP stats. The server routes then send back the MVP data back as JSON when the endpoint is called.

## Further Optimizations

Since this was a fairly simple project, I don't think there was much need for further optimizations.


## Future Consideration

Some additional things I would have liked to add were: 

1. Adding MVP data from the beginning of the NBA to present day

2. Adding additional stats such are blocks, steals, PER, WS etc;

3. Doing some math on the serverside prior to send the data. (ie adding total base stats together ppg + rpg + apg) for comparison sake

4. Creating another application that uses the API data

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to make an API that follows REST standards and returns the data as JSON
